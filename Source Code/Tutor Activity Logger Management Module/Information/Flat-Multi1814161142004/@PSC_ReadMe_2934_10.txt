Title: Flat-Multicolumn combobox with autocomplete
Description: Me and my colleague Massimiliano Silvestro have developed a combobox control derived from the base combobox supplied with VS.NET. This combobox has some interesting features like 
- Multiple Column (for now, max 4) with configurable widths 
- Flat look similar to the XP combobox 
- Highlight combobox border and arrow on MouseEnter and GotFocus events 
- Autocomplete text written in the text area, basing on first column values 
- Overriden DropDownStyle property to manage autocomplete feature with DropDownList style 
- Loading the combobox via MTGCComboboxItem or through a DataTable 
- Custom colors for border (highlighted and not), arrow, dropdownlist grid etc. 
- Custom designer used to disable/enable properties at design time, managing verbs etc. 
In the attached .zip file you will find the source code of the control, a simple application that shows the features of the control, am html file with some examples on how to load data in the combobox.
Have a look and let me know what you think!
