Tutor-Activity-Logger-Management-Module
=======================================

Commerce I.T. required a system whereby they could log their helpdesk tutor activity and as such create a record of all work done in the labs. Tutor Activity Logger is a simple SQL Server driven application that allow for the capturing and storing of Tutor's activities whilst on lab duty. To access the system, Novell group membership is required as a check is made against the local UCT LDAP server as to whether or not the tutor is a valid user. Created by Craig Lotter, November 2005
