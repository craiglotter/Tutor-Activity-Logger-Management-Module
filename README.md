Tutor Activity Logger Management Module
=======================================

Commerce I.T. required a system whereby they could log their helpdesk tutor activity and as such create a record of all work done in the labs. Tutor Activity Logger is a simple SQL Server driven application that allow for the capturing and storing of Tutor's activities whilst on lab duty. To access the system, Novell group membership is required as a check is made against the local UCT LDAP server as to whether or not the tutor is a valid user.

Built on the same shell as Tutor Activity Logger, Tutor Activity Logger Management Module is a essential extension that allows the system administrator to make crucial updates to the database to ensure the original application's extensibility as well as to perform simple day-to-day database maintenance.
